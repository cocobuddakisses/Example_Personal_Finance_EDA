### 📂 Personal Finance EDA
This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a personal finance dataset.
It aims to help understand spending habits, income trends, and overall financial health.

## ✅ Goals
Visualize how money is spent by category

Track income and expenses over time with a line chart

Compare total expenses to income

Calculate net savings per month, or in this case, debt

Formulate future finances if spending habits remain the same

## 📈 What’s included
Data cleaning: Checked and converted date formats, extracted month for trend analysis

Visualizations:

Expenses by category (pie graph)

Income vs expenses (bar plot)

Monthly trends (line plot)

Yearly Net Balance (line plot)

Insights: Identified which categories take up most spending, how income compares to expenses, and seasonal spending patterns.
